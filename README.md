# CSS Specificity and !important Conflict

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to the interaction between `!important` declarations and CSS specificity.  The bug highlights a scenario where a more specific selector fails to override a rule with the `!important` flag.

## Bug Description

A more specific CSS selector should normally override a less specific one. However, when a less specific selector uses `!important`, the more specific selector might unexpectedly be ignored. This can lead to unexpected styling results.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open `bug.css`.
2. Examine the provided CSS code.
3. Observe the unexpected styling outcome in a browser.

## Solution

Refer to `solution.css` for a possible solution. The best approach often involves refactoring the CSS to avoid the need for `!important` declarations and instead utilize a more well-structured and maintainable approach to specificity.
