The most robust solution is to avoid using `!important` whenever possible.  Refactoring your CSS to rely on proper specificity rules is usually a better long-term strategy.  However, if `!important` is unavoidable, careful consideration of specificity is crucial.

The problem can be solved by either removing the `!important` declaration or changing the order of CSS rules. The order matters when specificity is equal. 

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}
```

In this corrected CSS, the `.parent .child` selector, being more specific, will always take precedence, regardless of the order.
