The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

<div class="parent">
  <span class="child"></span>
</div>
```

The `!important` declaration in the `.child` class overrides the `color: blue` from the `.parent` class. However, the more specific selector `.parent .child` should override the `.child` selector because of its higher specificity. But it does not override the `!important` rule.  The expected color for the span is green, but the actual color will be red.
